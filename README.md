# phpConstantToCsv
A simple Ruby script to replace PHP "define function" into a plain csv file. I used this script in order to facilitate the translation for functional team.

##Use
Simply run the phpConstantToCsv script and pass it the files arguments.
<pre>
 ruby phpConstantToCsv.rb constant_file_1.php constant_file_2.php
</pre>

##Output
You will obtain as many csv files you set in the input parameters :
- constant_file_1.php.csv
- constant_file_2.php.csv
